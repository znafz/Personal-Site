                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Zachary Nafziger.</p>
                <p>I live in Lititz, PA, and I have passions for both computer science and music.</p>
                <h4>Computer Science</h4>
                <p class="jumbotron" style="background-color:#191919">
                  I am currently a senior at Grove City College, where I am majoring in Computer Science.
                  I have an overall GPA of <strong>3.19</strong> and a major GPA of <strong>3.53.</strong>
                  In addition to my education, I have done some learning on my own. A few technical skills that I have
                  researched outside of school are Web Design, Graphic Design, Data Science, and a number of
                  languages, such as Python, R, etc.
                </p>
                <h4>Music</h4>
                <p class="jumbotron" style="background-color:#191919">
                  One of my favorite side hobbies is music production and performance. Although I have no formal training,
                  I'm self-taught in guitar, singing, and music production. I've been writing my own music since late 2010, and
                  one of my early productions has more than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4KAFMS4MOY" target = "_blank"> 3.2 million hits.</a>
                  Since this, I've added vocals to my songs and improved tremendously in my songwriting, mixing, and mastering capabilities.

      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
              <h2>Education</h2>
              <p>In my time at Grove City, I have learned a number of valuable skills. I have primarily used C++
              and I've gained considerable knowledge in Object Oriented Programming. I have also taken classes
              in Database Management, Introductory Computer Graphics, and Game Design & Development, to name a few.
              In addition to these technical skills, I've seen improvements in my mastery of writing, public speaking,
              and general communication, and have even found myself enjoying those aspects.
            </p><p>
              I've found that as my classes have increased in difficulty, my desire to excel has grown, and my grades
              reflect that. The pressure of more difficult projects hasn't deterred my love of computer science, but rather
              has increased it. I enjoy being challenged and creating new solutions to complex problems.
            </p><p>
              Another major part of my experience at Grove City is my on-campus involvement. During my time I've been involved
              in a few on-campus organizations and events. I am a member of the Adelphikos fraternity. As a group, we seek to be men of honor and men of courage.
              The fraternity is very active on campus and seeks to promote unity between the Greek and independent communities through outreach, social activities, and a Christ-centered lifestyle.
              I've also been a part of CRU, where I have served as the Weekly Meeting Leader, along with helping to lead worship.

              <h2>Experience</h2>
              <p> Although my education has been important, there are a few skills that I've learned outside
                of it.
              </p>
              <h4>The Hershey Company - Application Development Intern</h4>
              <p class="jumbotron" style="background-color:#191919">
                During the summer of 2014, I was an Application Development Intern with <a href="https://www.thehersheycompany.com/" target="_blank">The Hershey Company.</a>
                This experience was a wonderful introduction to the professional world and I learned a lot
                of valuable skills, along with building applications that the company now uses. During my time,
                I worked with a number of SAP products, including Business Explorer, Business Warehouse,
                Hana, Web Intelligence, and Analysis for Office. As a direct result of my time, I gained an
                interest in Data Science, and would love to pursue it further.<br>This summer, I returned
                for a second internship. This time, I'm working with a different division of the company and gaining
                experience with Grails, Vagrant, Wit, and more.
              </p>
              <h4>Grove City College - Computer Helpdesk Associate</h4>
              <p class="jumbotron" style="background-color:#191919">
                In my junior year, I began working at Grove City College's Computer Helpdesk. <br>Some of my main responsibities
                include fixing software issues on school-issued devices and providing customer service. Although this
                has improved my computer skills, it has perhaps served to grow my customer interaction skills even more.
